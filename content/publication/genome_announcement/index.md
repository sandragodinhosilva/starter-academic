title: Draft genome sequence of Sphingorhabdus sp. strain EL138, a metabolically
  versatile Alphaproteobacterium isolated from the gorgonian coral Eunicella
  labiata
abstract: Here, we report the draft genome sequence of Sphingorhabdus sp. strain
  EL138, an alphaproteobacterium that shows potential to degrade polycyclic
  aromatic compounds and to cope with various heavy metals and antibiotics.
  Moreover, the strain, isolated from the gorgonian coral Eunicella labiata,
  possesses several genes involved in the biosynthesis of polyphosphates,
  polyketides, and terpenoids.
