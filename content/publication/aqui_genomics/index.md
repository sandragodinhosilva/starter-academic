abstract: This study determines the natural product biosynthesis and full coding
  potential within the bacterial genus Aquimarina. Using comprehensive
  phylogenomics and functional genomics, we reveal that phylogeny instead of
  isolation source [host‐associated (HA) vs. free‐living (FL) habitats]
  primarily shape the inferred metabolism of Aquimarina species. These can be
  coherently organized into three major functional clusters, each presenting
  distinct natural product biosynthesis profiles suggesting that evolutionary
  trajectories strongly underpin their secondary metabolite repertoire and
  presumed bioactivities. Aquimarina spp. are highly versatile bacteria equipped
  to colonize HA and FL microniches, eventually displaying opportunistic
  behaviour, owing to their shared ability to produce multiple glycoside
  hydrolases from diverse families. We furthermore uncover previously
  underestimated, and highly complex secondary metabolism for the genus by
  detecting 928 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) across all genomes, grouped in
  439 BGC families, with polyketide synthases (PKSs), terpene synthases and
  non‐ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) ranking as the most frequent BGCs
  encoding drug‐like candidates. We demonstrate that the recently described
  cuniculene (trans‐AT PKS) BGC is conserved among, and specific to, the here
  delineated A. megaterium‐macrocephali‐atlantica phylogenomic clade. Our
  findings provide a timely and in‐depth perspective of an under‐explored yet
  emerging keystone taxon in the cycling of organic matter and secondary
  metabolite production in marine ecosystems.
