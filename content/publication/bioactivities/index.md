abstract: Octocorals (Cnidaria, Anthozoa Octocorallia) are magnificent
  repositories of natural products with fascinating and unusual chemical
  structures and bioactivities of interest to medicine and biotechnology.
  However, mechanistic understanding of the contribution of microbial symbionts
  to the chemical diversity of octocorals is yet to be achieved. This review
  inventories the natural products so-far described for octocoral-derived
  bacteria and fungi, uncovering a true chemical arsenal of terpenes, steroids,
  alkaloids, and polyketides with antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral,
  antifouling, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antimalarial activities of
  enormous potential for blue growth. Genome mining of 15 bacterial associates
  (spanning 12 genera) cultivated from Eunicella spp. resulted in the
  identification of 440 putative and classifiable secondary metabolite
  biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), encompassing varied terpene-, polyketide-,
  bacteriocin-, and nonribosomal peptide-synthase BGCs. This points towards a
  widespread yet uncharted capacity of octocoral-associated bacteria to
  synthetize a broad range of natural products. However, to extend our knowledge
  and foster the near-future laboratory production of bioactive compounds from
  (cultivatable and currently uncultivatable) octocoral symbionts, optimal
  blending between targeted metagenomics, DNA recombinant technologies, improved
  symbiont cultivation, functional genomics, and analytical chemistry are
  required. Such a multidisciplinary undertaking is key to achieving a
  sustainable response to the urgent industrial demand for novel drugs and
  enzyme varieties.
