My name is Sandra and Iâ€™m a PhD at a doctoral program in biotechnology and biosciences. I'm also a certified pharmacist with experience in community pharmacy and medical devices. Nevertheless, what I really consider myself to be is a bioinformatician.

I am now working in the application of machine learning algorithms to solve long unknown biological questions. By combining notions of microbiology and genomics with bioinformatic tools, I aim to explore the secondary metabolism of microorganisms and to find molecules with potential therapeutic activity.
